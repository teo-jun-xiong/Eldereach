== Purpose
Eldereach is developed with the intention to bridge the caregivers of elderly and charity organizations, and service providers.It was developed seeing as there is a lack of information for the elderly on the services available to them. Eldereach leverages on the already-present caregivers, who are technologically savvy enough to utilize Eldereach to help the elderly they are caring for.

== Features
Eldereach has 5 core features for the caregivers (or the elderly). v1.0 of Eldereach is currently only optimised for a large screen size of around 2960 x 1440 pixels.
