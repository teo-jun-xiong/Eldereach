## Purpose
Eldereach is developed with the intention to bridge the caregivers of elderly and charity organizations, and service providers. It was developed seeing as there is a lack of information for the elderly on the services available to them. Eldereach leverages on the already-present caregivers, who are likely to be technologically savvy enough to utilize Eldereach to help the elderly they are caring for.
